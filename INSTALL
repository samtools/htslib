System Requirements
===================

HTSlib depends on the zlib library <http://zlib.net>.  Building HTSlib requires
zlib development files to be installed on the build machine; you may need to
ensure a package such as zlib1g-dev (on Debian or Ubuntu Linux) or zlib-devel
(on RPM/yum-based distributions) is installed.


Compilation
===========

'cd' to the htslib-1.x directory containing the package's source and type
'make' to compile HTSlib.


Installation
============

Type 'make install' to install the bgzip and tabix utilities, library headers,
library archives, several manual pages, and a pkgconfig file to /usr/local.

Type 'make prefix=/path/to/dir install' to install everything under your
choice of installation directory.  The install target also understands
DESTDIR and the other usual installation directory variables.
