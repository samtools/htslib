.SH DESCRIPTION
The S3 plugin allows htslib file functions to communicate with servers that use
the AWS S3 protocol.  Files are identified by their bucket and object key in a
URL format e.g.

.B s3://mybucket/path/to/file

With \fIpath/to/file\fR being the object key.

Necessary security information can be provided in as part of the URL, in
environment variables or from configuration files.

The full URL format is:

.B s3[+SCHEME]://[ID[:SECRET[:TOKEN]]@]BUCKET/PATH

The elements are:
.TP
.I SCHEME
The protocol used.  Defaults to \fIhttps\fR.
.TP
.I ID
The user AWS access key.
.TP
.I SECRET
The secret key for use with the access key.
.TP
.I TOKEN
Token used for temporary security credentials.
.TP
.I BUCKET
AWS S3 bucket.
.TP
.I PATH
Path to the object under the bucket.
.LP

The environment variables below will be used if the user ID is not set.
.TP
.B AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
The user AWS access key.
.TP
.B AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
The secret key for use with the access key.
.TP
.B AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
The region to use. Defaults to
.IR us-east-1 .
.TP
.B AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
Token used for temporary security credentials.
.TP
.B AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE
The profile to use in \fIcredentials\fR, \fIconfig\fR or \fIs3cfg\fR files.
Defaults to
.IR default .
.TP
.B AWS_PROFILE
Same as above.
.TP
.B AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE
Location of the credentials file.  Defaults to
.IR ~/.aws/credentials .
.TP
.B HTS_S3_S3CFG
Location of the s3cfg file.  Defaults to
.IR ~/.s3cfg .
.TP
.B HTS_S3_HOST
Sets the host.  Defaults to
.IR s3.amazonaws.com .
.TP
.B HTS_S3_V2
If set use signature v2 rather the default v4.  This will limit the plugin to
reading only.
.TP
.B HTS_S3_PART_SIZE
Sets the upload part size in Mb, the minimum being 5Mb.
By default the part size starts at 5Mb and expands at regular intervals to
accommodate bigger files (up to 2.5 Tbytes with the current rate).
Using this setting disables the automatic part size expansion.
.TP
.B HTS_S3_ADDRESS_STYLE
Sets the URL style.  Options are auto (default), virtual or path.  
.LP
In the absence of an ID from the previous two methods the credential/config
files will be used.  The default file locations are either
\fI~/.aws/credentials\fR or \fI~/.s3cfg\fR (in that order).

Entries used in aws style credentials file are aws_access_key_id, 
aws_secret_access_key, aws_session_token, region and addressing_style.  Only the
first two are usually needed.

Entries used in s3cmd style config files are access_key, secret_key,
access_token, host_base, bucket_location and host_bucket. Again only the first
two are usually needed. The host_bucket option is only used to set a path-style
URL, see below.

.SH NOTES
In most cases this plugin transforms the given URL into a virtual host-style
format e.g. \fIhttps://bucket.host/path/to/file\fR.  A path-style format is used
where the URL is not DNS compliant or the bucket name contains a dot e.g.
\fIhttps://host/bu.cket/path/to/file\fR.

Path-style can be forced by setting one either HTS_S3_ADDRESS_STYLE,
addressing_style or host_bucket.  The first two can be set to \fBpath\fR while
host_bucket must \fBnot\fR include the \fB%(bucket).s\fR string.
