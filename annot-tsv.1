.SH NAME
annot\-tsv \- transfer annotations from one TSV (tab\-separated values) file into another
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B annot-tsv
.RI [ OPTIONS ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The program finds overlaps in two sets of genomic regions (for example two CNV call sets) and annotates regions of the target file
.RB ( \-t ", " \-\-target\-file )
with information from overlapping regions of the source file
.RB ( \-s ", " \-\-source\-file ).

It can transfer one or multiple columns
.RB ( \-f ", " \-\-transfer )
and the transfer can be conditioned on requiring matching values in one or more columns
.RB ( \-m ", " \-\-match ).
In addition to column transfer
.RB ( \-f )
and special annotations
.RB ( \-a ", " \-\-annotate ),
the program can operate in a simple grep-like mode and print matching lines (when neither
.B \-f
nor
.B \-a
are given) or drop matching lines
.RB ( \-x ", " \-\-drop-overlaps ).

All indexes and coordinates are 1-based and inclusive.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "Common Options"
.PP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-core " SRC:TGT"
.RS 4
List of names of the core columns (chromosome, start and end coordinate) in the source and the target file (for example "chr,beg,end:CHROM,START,END"). If both files use the same format, the TGT names can be omitted (for example "chr,beg,end"). If SRC or TGT file has no header, 1-based indexes can be given instead (for example "chr,beg,end:1,2,3"). Note that regions are not required, the program can work with a list of positions (for example "chr,beg,end:CHROM,POS,POS").
.RE
.PP
.BR \-f ", " \-\-transfer " SRC:TGT"
.RS 4
Comma-separated list of columns to transfer. If the SRC column does not exist, interpret it as the default value to fill in when a match is found or a dot (".") when a match is not found. If the TGT column does not exist, a new column is created. If the TGT column already exists, its values will be overwritten when overlap is found and left as is otherwise.

.RS 4
Minimum overlap as a fraction of region length in at least one of the overlapping regions. If also

overlap with respect to both regions

Drop overlapping regions (cannot be combined with

.SH EXAMPLE

Both SRC and TGT input files must be tab-delimited files with or without a header, their columns can be named differently, can appear in arbitrary order. For example consider the source file

.EX
#chr   beg   end   sample   type   qual
chr1   100   200   smpl1    DEL    10
chr1   300   400   smpl2    DUP    30
.EE
and the target file
.EX
150   200   chr1   smpl1
150   200   chr1   smpl2
350   400   chr1   smpl1
350   400   chr1   smpl2
.EE
In the first example we transfer type and quality but only for regions with matching sample. Notice that the header is present in SRC but not in TGT, therefore we use column indexes for the latter
.EX
annot-tsv -s src.txt.gz -t tgt.txt.gz -c chr,beg,end:3,1,2 -m sample:4 -f type,qual
150   200   chr1   smpl1   DEL   10
150   200   chr1   smpl2   .     .
350   400   chr1   smpl1   .     .
350   400   chr1   smpl2   DUP   30
.EE

One of the SRC or TGT file can be streamed from stdin
.EX
cat src.txt | annot\-tsv \-t tgt.txt \-c chr,beg,end:3,2,1 \-m sample:4 \-f type,qual \-o output.txt
cat tgt.txt | annot\-tsv \-s src.txt \-c chr,beg,end:3,2,1 \-m sample:4 \-f type,qual \-o output.txt
.EE

The program can be used in a grep-like mode to print only matching regions of the target file without modifying the records

.EX
annot\-tsv \-s src.txt \-t tgt.txt \-c chr,beg,end:3,2,1 \-m sample:4
150   200   chr1   smpl1
350   400   chr1   smpl2
.EE
