.SH "NAME"
annot-tsv \- transfer annotations from one TSV (tab\-separated values) file into another
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBannot\-tsv\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The program finds overlaps in two sets of genomic regions (for example two CNV call sets) and annotates regions of the target file (\fI\-t, \-\-target\-file\fR) with information from overlapping regions of the source file (\fI\-s, \-\-source\-file\fR)\&.
.sp
It can transfer one or multiple columns (\fI\-f, \-\-transfer\fR) and the transfer can be conditioned on requiring matching values in one or more columns (\fI\-m, \-\-match\fR)\&. In addition to column transfer (\fI\-f\fR) and special annotations (\fI\-a, \-\-annotate\fR), the program can operate in a simple grep\-like mode and print matching lines (when neither \fI\-f\fR nor \fI\-a\fR are given) or drop matching lines (\fI\-x, \-\-drop\-overlaps\fR)\&.
.sp
All indexes and coordinates are 1\-based and inclusive\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Common Options"
.PP
\fB\-c, \-\-core\fR \fISRC:TGT\fR
.RS 4
List of names of the core columns (chromosome, start and end coordinate) in the source and the target file (for example "chr,beg,end:CHROM,START,END")\&. If both files use the same format, the TGT names can be omitted (for example "chr,beg,end")\&. If SRC or TGT file has no header, 1\-based indexes can be given instead (for example "chr,beg,end:1,2,3")\&. Note that regions are not required, the program can work with a list of positions (for example "chr,beg,end:CHROM,POS,POS")\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f, \-\-transfer\fR \fISRC:TGT\fR
.RS 4
Comma\-separated list of columns to transfer\&. If the SRC column does not exist, interpret it as the default value to fill in when a match is found or a dot ("\&.") when a match is not found\&. If the TGT column does not exist, a new column is created\&. If the TGT column already exists, its values will be overwritten when overlap is found and left as is otherwise\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-m, \-\-match\fR \fISRC:TGT\fR
.RS 4
The columns required to be identical
.RE
.PP
\fB\-o, \-\-output\fR \fIFILE\fR
.RS 4
Output file name, by default the result is printed on standard output
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s, \-\-source\-file\fR \fIFILE\fR
.RS 4
Source file with annotations to transfer
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t, \-\-target\-file\fR \fIFILE\fR

Target file to be extend with annotations from
\fB\-s, \-\-source\-file\fR

.SS "Other options"
.PP
\fB\-\-allow\-dups\fR
.RS 4
Add the same annotations multiple times if multiple overlaps are found
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-max\-annots\fR \fIINT\fR
.RS 4
Add at most INT annotations per column to save time when many overlaps are found with a single region
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Print version string and exit
.RE
.PP
\fB\-a, \-\-annotate\fR \fILIST\fR
.RS 4
Add one or more special annotation
.PP
\fIcnt\fR
.RS 4
number of overlapping regions
.RE
.PP
\fIfrac\fR
.RS 4
fraction of the target region with an overlap
.RE

\fInbp\fR
.RS 4
number of source base pairs in the overlap
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-H, \-\-ignore\-headers\fR
.RS 4
Ignore the headers completely and use numeric indexes even when a header exists
.RE
.PP
\fB\-O, \-\-overlap\fR \fIFLOAT\fR
.RS 4
Minimum required overlap (non\-reciprocal, unless also
\fB\-r, \-\-reciprocal\fR
is given)
.RE

\fB\-r, \-\-reciprocal\fR
.RS 4
Require reciprocal overlap with

Drop overlapping regions (cannot be combined with
\fB\-f, \-\-transfer\fR)

.SH "EXAMPLE"
.sp
Both SRC and TGT input files must be tab\-delimited files with or without a header, their columns can be named differently, can appear in arbitrary order\&. For example consider the source file
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
#chr   beg   end   sample   type   qual
chr1   100   110   Ted      DEL    39
chr1   333   335   Lasso    DUP    59
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
and the target file
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
300   400   chr1   Lasso
100   200   chr1   Ted
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The following examples demonstrate the usage
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# Transfer type and quality\&. The header is present in SRC but not in TGT, therefore use
# column indexes for the latter\&.
annot\-tsv \-s src\&.txt\&.gz \-t tgt\&.txt\&.gz \-c chr,beg,end:3,1,2 \-m sample:4 \-f type,qual \-o output\&.txt

# One of the SRC or TGT file can be streamed from stdin
cat src\&.txt | annot\-tsv \-t tgt\&.txt \-c chr,beg,end:3,2,1 \-m sample:4 \-f type,qual \-o output\&.txt
cat tgt\&.txt | annot\-tsv \-s src\&.txt \-c chr,beg,end:3,2,1 \-m sample:4 \-f type,qual \-o output\&.txt

# Print matching regions as above but without modifying the records
cat src\&.txt | annot\-tsv \-t tgt\&.txt \-c chr,beg,end:3,2,1 \-m sample:4 > matching\&.txt
