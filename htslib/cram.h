 * Renumbers RG numbers in a cram compression header.

 * string holding the ID: tag.  This is smaller in space, but means
 * "samtools cat" to join files together that contain single but
 * different RG lines needs a way of renumbering them.
 *
 * The file descriptor is expected to be immediately after the
 * cram_container structure (ie before the cram compression header).
 * Due to the nature of the CRAM format, this needs to read and write
 * the blocks itself.  Note that there may be multiple slices within
 * the container, meaning multiple compression headers to manipulate.
 * Changing RG may change the size of the compression header and
 * therefore the length field in the container.  Hence we rewrite all
 * blocks just in case and also emit the adjusted container.
 *
 * The current implementation can only cope with renumbering a single
 * RG (and only then if it is using HUFFMAN or BETA codecs).  In
 * theory it *may* be possible to renumber multiple RGs if they use
 * HUFFMAN to the CORE block or use an external block unshared by any
 * other data series.  So we have an API that can be upgraded to
 * support this, but do not implement it for now.  An example
 * implementation of RG as an EXTERNAL block would be to find that
 * block and rewrite it, returning the number of blocks consumed.
