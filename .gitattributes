# Ensure BAM and CRAM files are left as binary.  To display changes in them
# by converting to SAM, add to your configuration (perhaps with --global):
#
#	git config diff.bam.textconv  "samtools view -h"
#	git config diff.cram.textconv "samtools view -h"
*.bam     -text diff=bam
*.cram    -text diff=cram

# Omit these files from release tarballs.
